# EDA
The project is related to booking information and analysis of two hotels namely City Hotel and Resort Hotel. The dataset contains 119390 rows along with 32 columns. 
The whole process is further subdivided into several parts of collecting, cleaning and manipulating the data for better understanding, then after EDA is performed. 
EDA or Exploratory Data Analysis refers to critical process of investigation on data to discover patterns, to spot anomalies, to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations. 
In the first step of data collection, few operations have been done to understand the columns and data in them using methods such as,
# .head() # .tail() # .info() # .describe() # .columns()
# and so forth.
In the cleaning part we have removed the duplicated columns that were present in the dataset. In the manipulation segment we have created out few of the new columns using existing ones and removed redundancy. 
All the unique values of every column are presented in tabular format for easy understanding. A few numerical columns are converted into their categorical equivalent and vice versa. 
After performing those mentioned operations we have come up with a dataset consisting 87396 columns along with 35 odd columns.
Different charts are created for data visualization so that better insights and Business objective is attained from the underlying pattern of the data.

Problem Statement: 
The business problem that the hotel booking dataset aims to solve is to help hotels optimize their revenue by providing insights into the factors that influence hotel bookings. 
The dataset contains information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. 
By analysing this data, hotels can identify patterns and trends that can help them make better decisions about pricing, marketing, and other aspects of their business.
